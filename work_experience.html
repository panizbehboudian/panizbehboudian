							<h3><i><b>AI Research Engineer</b> at <span style="color:chocolate;">Huawei</span> Autonomous Driving Car Team, Huawei IC-Lab, Canada</i></h3>
							<h4 style="color:DarkGrey;">Summer 2022- Now</h4>
							    <ul>
								    <li> As a research engineer, my primary focus is to plan for rare and critical driving scenarios for autonomous vehicles (AVs). I am inspired by the way humans use their imagination to plan for the future, and I strive to train and prepare AVs to make safe and smart decisions in critical situations. To achieve this, I am leveraging comprehensive and reliable world models and utilizing model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods.</li>

									<li>A significant portion of my job includes staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in AV technology to predict the key players in the industry for the next few years and design our hardware accordingly. I am continuously researching and distilling novel methods, and effectively communicating and sharing my ideas with my team and managers. I am also responsible for ensuring that the team stays informed about the latest developments in the field, and that our hardware and software are up-to-date.</li>

									<li>Overall, my role requires a combination of technical expertise, strategic thinking, and effective communication skills. I am passionate about utilizing cutting-edge technology to develop safe and reliable AVs, and I am committed to making a positive impact on the industry.</li>

              				<h3><i><b>AI Research Engineer</b> at <span style="color:chocolate;">Huawei</span> Research Centre, IC-Lab, Edmonton, Canada</i></h3>
							<h4 style="color:DarkGrey;">Winter 2020- Spring 2022</h4>
							    <ul>
								    <li> As a research engineer, I was an active member of a team that focused on developing <span style="color:chocolate;">neural architecture search (NAS)</span> algorithms for the AutoML pipeline. Our goal was to build smarter and more efficient search methods to improve the performance metrics of any given architecture. Our frameworks had great successes in well-known NAS benchmark datasets as well as many in-house specialized models. These efforts directly affected the cutting-edge technology used in Huawei products, making them more efficient and accurate.</li>

									<li>A major portion of my job was dedicated to distillation and visualization of the knowledge gained from the raw architecture search data. This included analyzing the results, identifying patterns, and extracting insights to inform the design of new algorithms and architectures. I was also responsible for presenting the findings to the team and key stakeholders in a clear and concise manner, and for making recommendations for future research and development.</li>

									<li>In addition to having a strong understanding of neural architecture search and machine learning, my role also required the ability to effectively communicate technical information to a non-technical audience. I was also expected to be well-versed with the current state-of-the-art research in the field and to actively stay updated with the latest advancements in the field..
